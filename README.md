# Diwali Sales Analysis

## Introduction
Diwali, the festival of lights, is one of the most celebrated occasions in India, marked by grand celebrations and significant shopping activities. Businesses across various sectors witness a surge in sales during this festive season, offering discounts and promotions to attract customers. This project, Diwali Sales Data Analysis, aims to analyze sales data during the Diwali season to uncover valuable insights into customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and product performance.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this analysis contains detailed sales data from the Diwali festive season. It includes information such as customer demographics (age, gender, marital status), purchase details (product categories, orders, and amount), and geographical insights (state). This dataset serves as the foundation for identifying patterns and trends in customer behavior and sales performance.

## Objective
